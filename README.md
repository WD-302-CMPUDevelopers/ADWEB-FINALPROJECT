Adweb Finals Project

Application Background:

The Barbershop Website is designed to serve as a comprehensive platform advocating for the barber shop industry. In recent years, barbershops have experienced a resurgence, not only as places for grooming but also as cultural hubs within communities. This website aims to celebrate the rich history and significance of barbershops while providing valuable resources for barbers, aspiring professionals, and the general public.

Frameworks and Components:

1. Frontend Framework:
   - The website utilizes the React.js framework for its frontend development. React.js provides a flexible and efficient way to build user interfaces, allowing for dynamic content presentation and seamless interactivity.

2. Backend Framework:
   - For the backend, the website relies on Node.js with Express.js. Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution, while Express.js simplifies the development of robust web applications by providing a minimalist and flexible framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic.

3. Database Management:
   - MongoDB serves as the database management system, chosen for its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB's document-oriented architecture is well-suited for managing diverse types of data, including user profiles, barber shop listings, and blog content.
